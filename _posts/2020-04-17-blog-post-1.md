This is an effective and practical way I learnt from [CS294-AI-Sys](https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-ai-sys-fa19/assets/lectures/lec02/02_ai-sys-big-ideas_v2.pdf) to read a paper critically for a beginner in academy. In the future I will follow this method to keep updating some of my research reviews and thoughts in this blog.

Neutral: recap of the paper
------
* What is the problem being solved?
* Related work
* What was the solution? (Summary!)
* What metrics did they use to evaluate their solution?
* What were the Baselines of comparison?
* What was the key insight or enabling idea?
* What are the claimed technical contributions?

Advocate: Strengths of the paper & Critic: Weaknesses of the paper
------
Try to answer the following questions from both advocate and critic perspectives
* Novelty and Impact
  * Are the problem and solution novel and how will the solution affect future research?
* Technical Qualities
  * Are the problem framing and assumptions reasonable?
* Discuss merits of the technical contributions
  * Does the evaluation support claims and reveal limitations of the proposed approach?
* Presentation
  * Discuss the writing clarity and presentation of results
  * Positioning of related work

Rebuttal
------
* How could the authors address the criticâ€™s concerns?
* How might the authors have improved the paper? 
  * Technically
  * Presentation
